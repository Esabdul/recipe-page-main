It features clear sections, semantic HTML5 elements, and an accessible, responsive layout suitable for all screen sizes.

## My process

I approached this project by:

- Structuring semantic HTML sections for accessibility
- Focusing on a mobile-first responsive layout
- Styling with custom CSS variables and consistent spacing
- Ensuring hover effects are smooth and non-distracting
- Using transitions, shadows, and modern

---

## Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **CSS Flexbox** and layout best practices
- Custom properties for color tokens
- **Responsive design** without media queries (mobile-first layout works smoothly)
- Vanilla **CSS transitions** for interactivity

---

## What I learned

- How to build accessible and semantic layouts with `<main>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, etc.
- Managing hover effects in lists and tables gracefully
- Importance of using consistent spacing and color tokens
- Using **Google Fonts** and combining font families like _Outfit_ and _Young Serif_
- Table formatting and improving accessibility through readable color contrast

```css
.instructions-list li:hover {
  background-color: hsl(330, 100%, 98%);
  transform: scale(1.01);
  box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);
}
```

## Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Practice media queries for layout tweaks at breakpoints
- Explore CSS Grid alongside Flexbox
- Dive deeper into accessibility reports and ARIA roles
- Get more comfortable writing documentation like this README
